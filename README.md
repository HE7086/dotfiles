[![Deploy Dotfiles](https://github.com/HE7086/dotfiles/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HE7086/dotfiles/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml)

* This repo contains dotfiles I use on all of my linux machines (Mainly Archlinux)
* controlled by GNU stow
* install all dotfiles with `make`
* install single file with `make <package>`, e.g. `make zsh`
* **Note**: Most of the commit messages are randomly generated using `git yolo`, they do not make any sense ;)
